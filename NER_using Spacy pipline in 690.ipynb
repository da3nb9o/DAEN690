A medicine cabinet, container, or compartment shall be used for storage of medications\\\\n and dietary supplements prescribed for residents when such medications and dietary\\\\n supplements are administered by the facility. Medications shall be stored in a manner\\\\n consistent with current standards of practice.\\\\n \\\\n 1. The storage area shall be locked.\\\\n \\\\n 2. Schedule II drugs and any other drugs subject to abuse must be kept in a separate locked\\\\n storage compartment (e.g., a locked cabinet within a locked storage area or a locked\\\\n container within a locked cabinet or cart).\\\\n \\\\n 3. The individual responsible for medication administration shall keep the keys to the\\\\n storage area on his person.\\\\n \\\\n 4. When in use, the storage area shall have adequate illumination in order to read container\\\\n labels.\\\\n \\\\n 5. The storage area shall not be located in the kitchen or bathroom, but in an area free of\\\\n dampness or abnormal temperatures unless the medication requires refrigeration.\\\\n \\\\n 6. When required, medications shall be refrigerated.\\\\n \\\\n a. It is permissible to store dietary supplements and foods and liquids used for\\\\n medication administration in a refrigerator that is dedicated to medication storage if\\\\n the refrigerator is in a locked storage area.\\\\n \\\\n b. When it is necessary to store medications in a refrigerator that is routinely used for\\\\n food storage, the medications shall be stored together in a locked container in a clearly\\\\n defined area.\\\\n \\\\n 7. Single-use and dedicated medical supplies and equipment shall be appropriately labeled\\\\n and stored. Medical equipment suitable for multi-use shall be stored to prevent cross-\\\\n contamination.\\\\n \\\\n B. A resident may be permitted to keep his own medication in an out-of-sight place in his\\\\n room if the UAI has indicated that the resident is capable of self-administering medication.\\\\n The medication and any dietary supplements shall be stored so that they are not accessible to\\\\n other residents. This does not prohibit the facility from storing or administering all\\\\n medication and dietary supplements.\\\\n \\\\n Exception: If the facility has no resident with a serious cognitive impairment or substance\\\\n abuse problem, the facility may determine that the out-of-sight and inaccessibility\\\\n safeguards specified in this subsection do not apply. If the facility determines that these\\\\n safeguards do not apply, the facility shall maintain documentation of such, including the\\\\n date and the names of residents at the time the determination is made. No such\\\\n determination shall be valid for longer than six months. Such determinations may be\\\\n renewed under the same conditions and with the same documentation requirements.\\\\n \\\\n Statutory Authority\\\\n §§ 63.2-217, 63.2-1732, 63.2-1802, 63.2-1805, and 63.2-1808 of the Code of Virginia.\\\\n \\\\n Historical Notes\\\\n Derived from Virginia Register Volume 34, Issue 6, eff.
